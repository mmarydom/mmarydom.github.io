    <p>My project would smell like the fresh, clean air after a rain shower, with the slight scent of seeds. In the distance, you can the birds chirping in a synchronized harmony as well as the sounds of their feathers taking flight. A small breeze is coming through the picture and you can feel the rays of the sun warm your skin.</p>
    <p>I have always had a liking towards birds. I have a few cockatiels, a type of parrot, as well as parakeets as pets and being inside their aviary always make me happy. When I feel too stress, I often go inside their aviary for breaks. Their songs and chirps I often find calming, so I find myself sitting inside for too long. They also are the ones who influenced me to do this piece.</p>
    <p>This collage is dedicated to my love of birds and the freedom they represent. Everywhere we go, we see these hordes of feathered friends take off in flight, leaving us to wonder where they go and what lands they reach. I admire their ability to soar and fly freely in the sky, leaving their worries on the ground. From this, I wanted the audience to experience the same happiness I feel surrounded by birds and ignore the pressure of fitting in society.</p>
