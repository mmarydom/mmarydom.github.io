  <p>The latest edition to my website is my 5th project, the ArtWare. I wanted this project to match with the aesthetic and theme of my blog, so I chose matching colors and cute images.</p>
  <p>For this project, I experimented with javascript and played around with the code mostly from the book Getting Started With p5.Js. This was alot harder to learn than HTML and css because it is a different language than the two. However, thanks to the coding I learned from my freshman year, I was able to understand it at least a little. I did have alot of trouble adding a few more elements to my project but in the end I chose to keep it sweet and simple.</p>
