  <p>My 3D model is inspired by the damage we humans cause towards nature, where our actions leads to destruction of many plants and animals. Here, mother nature towers above everyone as she moderates the balance between humans and nature. However, as time progresses, we humans begin to take advantage of our resources, ruining this balance. Within the box lies the heart of the Earth, which humans are seizing and as this happens, mother nature is slowly deteriorating by the hands of mankind. Coup D'Ã©tat illustrates this takeover of mankind that consumes everything in its path.
  <p>At first, I didn't really know what I was trying to make, but I did have the idea in mind. I began playing around with the rabbit through meshmixer, and the image I wanted began taking place. Unfortunately, I did add alot of other details, such as adding flowers around mother nature, but sketchfab was unable to render it because it was too big. So I decided to take a simpler approach. There isn't much detail but I hope the message was able to go through to those that see it.</p>
